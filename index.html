The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840, is a foundational document in New Zealand's history, 
marking an agreement between the British Crown and Māori chiefs. It aimed to establish peace, 
secure British sovereignty, and protect Māori rights and land. However, interpretation of the 
treaty's articles has been contentious,leading to ongoing debates and legal disputes over its 
meaning and implementation. The Treaty of Waitangi is considered the cornerstone of the relationship 
between the Crown and Māori, with its principles increasingly recognized in New Zealand law and society, shaping policies on indigenous rights, land ownership, and governance.
